### Basic Todo Syntax
The plugin works with standard Obsidian todo syntax:

Tasks are automatically assigned priorities based on keywords:
- **Priority A (üî¥)**: Critical, urgent tasks
- **Priority B (üü°)**: Important tasks
- **Priority C (üü¢)**: Normal tasks
- **Priority D (‚ö™)**: Low priority tasks

```

## Task Breakdown Analysis

The plugin includes intelligent analysis that helps identify problematic tasks:

### When Tasks Need Breakdown
- Tasks with very long descriptions
- Tasks that have been rescheduled multiple times
- Tasks with vague or unclear objectives
- Tasks that seem to contain multiple sub-objectives

### Auto-fix Suggestions
The plugin can automatically suggest fixes for:
- Missing time estimates
- Unclear task descriptions
- Missing priority assignments
- Improperly formatted date tags

### Breakdown Suggestions
When a task needs breakdown, the plugin suggests:
- Specific subtasks based on the main task
- Appropriate priorities for each subtask
- Time estimates for individual components
- Logical sequencing of subtasks

## Views and Interface

### Main Todo View
The main interface provides:
- **Filter buttons**: Quick access to different task views
- **Priority groups**: Tasks organized by priority level
- **Task actions**: Quick actions for each task (edit, assign to today, open file)
- **Progress indicators**: Visual progress for tasks with subtasks
- **Statistics panel**: Overview of task completion and productivity

### Task Display
Each task shows:
- **Checkbox**: Toggle completion status
- **Title and priority**: Task name with priority indicator
- **Time allocation**: Estimated time to complete
- **Due date**: When the task is due (if assigned)
- **Reschedule count**: How many times the task has been moved
- **Breakdown warnings**: Alerts when tasks need attention
- **Action buttons**: Quick access to common actions

2. Use subtasks for complex projects
3. Pay attention to breakdown suggestions
4. Regularly review and refactor task lists

### Productivity Optimization
1. Use the statistics panel to track progress
2. Set up end-of-day notifications
3. Review reschedule warnings to identify problematic tasks
